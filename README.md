# hello-world


Hi everyone! 

I'm Ben Fan, an aspiring data analyst who has experience working with Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL. I'm currently a PhD student studying philosophy at the University of Maryland, College Park, but I am journeying into data as a backup in case academia doesn't work out! (Also, data is fascinating to think about - what does the fact that data drives decision-making say about the kind of reasoners that we are as humans?)

Hoping to add some of my small contributions to GitHub!
